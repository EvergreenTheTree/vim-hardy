vim-hardy
=========

Introduction
------------

vim-hardy adds support for the Arduino language in vim.  It covers syntax,
compilation, and verification for Arduino code.  I decided to call this plugin
_"vim-hardy"_ because _"Arduino"_ means _"hardy friend"_ in italian. Note that I
did not write the arduino syntax file, it was generated by Johannes Hoff's
script which is available at [bitbucket.org/johannes/arduino-vim-syntax](http://bitbucket.org/johannes/arduino-vim-syntax).

Requirements
------------

Arduino IDE version 1.5.0 and up is required for the compilation and uploading
of Arduino code.  By default, vim-hardy looks for it in your PATH, but you can
specify an installation directory with `g:hardy_arduino_path`.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy
and paste:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/4Evergreen4/vim-hardy.git

Any other plugin managers should work as well, such as [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
or [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Usage
-----

To verify an Arduino file, run `:ArduinoVerify`.  To compile and upload it, use
`:ArduinoUpload`.
